# DDIONICH  GNU/Linux PC Configuration

## About
In this repository I have **my personal GNU/Linux PC (Ubuntu actually) configuration**. Here are my favorites Snap apps, gnome extensions and APT libraries. For now **only works on Ubuntu** (only 20.04 tested) because it uses things that we only found in Ubuntu package manager (APT).

## Installing
To **install** or **update** DGLPC, you should run the [install script](https://github.com/ddionich/my-linux-pc-config/blob/master/install.sh). To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:
```sh 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddionich/my-linux-pc-config/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```
or
```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddionich/my-linux-pc-config/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```
